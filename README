Spamgourmet Chrome Extension


A one click address generator for the spamgourmet.com service.

To install just download the files to some directory, open the
chrome browser. Go to settings > tools > extensions and click
on developer mode > load unpacked extension > specify the used
directory.

To use the service you will need to enter your spamgourmet user
name in the options of the extension (right click on the icon...).
Obviously you need a spamgourmet.com account which is free and
useful (thanks for the service, spamgourmet team).


Have fun with this little tool
